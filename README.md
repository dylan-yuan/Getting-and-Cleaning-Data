# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

##Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The original data used in this programme is :

##How it works
I divide my work into five steps to reach the goal and they can be explained as follow:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

  In this step, I merges the test and train data together and combine them by rows to creat one data set which is the base for the later cleanning work.
  
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

  With the work completed in step1, I can extract the data I want which is mean and standard deviation here.
  
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

  These two steps can be explained together. By doing these two steps, we can give the descriptive names for the data so that
  the numbers inside it has a clea meaning that everyone open it can quickly understand.
  
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  In this step, the final data set will be created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject based on   the data set in setp 4.
