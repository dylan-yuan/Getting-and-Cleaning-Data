##Row data source
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The raw data used in this programme is coming from the upper link.

##Data information
The data is collected from a wearing smartphone to collect the data of each person's activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

##Transformation process
The transformation I've done is guided by the instructions on the website which is:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Final Tidy Data file

In the tidy data set, we have variables including measurement; mean/standard deviation; X/Y/Z and mean.
